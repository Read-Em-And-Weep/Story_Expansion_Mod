--TODO: Update Unlock Requirements for the two upgrades

--[[Incantations to add
    - Meg appearing mid run
    - Allow Zag to visit the surface
    - Lower time for growth from Persephone
    - Meg find Fury Sisters incantation
    - Summon Eurydice
    - Eurydice food quality
    - Enable Theseus and Minotaur (sending out a signal to allied shades)
    - A new ambrosia alternative that involves you actually making something in alchemy (like a cake!) for new relationship levels
    
    - Freeing of Time
        - Fates' String (Plotline with Zagreus, Persephone and Hades? Moros should be involved if it's to do with fate)
            - Maybe this is the helping mortals plotline
            - Maybe just latch this onto the Fates plotline
        - Empowered Omphalos (Plotline involving collecting stones of each of the gods in shops, link to each of the gods as a story?)
        - Purified Fleece (Plotline exploring the witching aspect of the game, with Hecate, Selene, Medea and Circe? Maybe throw in some of the other witchy characters?)
        - Divine Inspiration (Plotline related to restoring Orpheus's inspiration?)

        - After doing it will require you complete a run against Rivals Chronos
    - Freeing of Monstrosity
        - Need to complete Freeing of Time (so some reagent from that, inverse of gaining Entropy), Dark Ephialtes (?) to link to Mel's nightmare aspect
        - Order/Singularity (Chaos questline? Maybe about growing closer with the progeny of Nyx?)
            - Chaos Trial reward for an extended chaos trial of above + below together with fear
        - Water of Resurrection (Questline themed around gaining samples of all the Underworld rivers?)
            - Link to a purifying rivers plotline of Eurydice, or maybe this can be a Hades/Persephone plotline
        - Sacred Dream - based on a Hypnos plotline ?

        - After doing it will require you complete a run against Rivals Typhon
